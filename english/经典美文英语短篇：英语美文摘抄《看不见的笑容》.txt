	　　Mr. Dawson was an old grouch, and everyone in town knew it. Kids knew not 
to go into his yard to pick a delicious apple, even off the ground, because old 
Dawson, they said, would come after you with his ball bullet gun.

	　　道森先生是个坏脾气的老头子，镇上的每个人都知道这个。小孩们知道不能到他的院子里摘美味的苹果，甚至掉在地上的也不能捡，因为据他们说，老道森会端着他的弹丸猎枪跟在你后面追。

	　　One Friday, 12-year-old Janet was going to stay all night with her friend 
Amy. They had to walk by Dawson’s house on the way to Amy’s house, but as they 
got close Janet saw him sitting on his front porchand suggested they cross over 
to the other side of the street. Like most of the children, she was scared of 
the old man because of the stories she’d heard about him.

	　　一个周五，12岁的珍妮特要陪她的朋友艾米过夜。她们去艾米家的途中得路过道森先生的房子。当她们离道森家越来越近时，珍妮特看见道森先生坐在前廊，于是她建议她们过马路从街的另一边走。跟大多数孩子一样，珍妮特听过他的故事，对他很是害怕。

	　　Amy said not to worry, Mr. Dawson wouldn’t hurt anyone. Still, Janet was 
growing more nervous with each step closer to the old man’s house. When they got 
close enough, Dawson looked up with his usualfrown, but when he saw it was Amy, 
a broad smile changed his entire face as he said, “Hello Miss Amy. I see you’ve 
got a little friend with you today.”

	　　艾米说别担心，道森先生不会伤害任何人。但每向前走一步，离老人的房子越近，珍妮特就越紧张。当她们走到房子那儿，道森抬起了头，一如既往地皱着他的眉头。但当他看到是艾米，一个灿烂的笑容让他整个表情都变了，他说：“你好，艾米小姐，我看见今天有位小朋友陪你。”

	　　Amy smiled back and told him Janet was staying overnight and they were 
going to listen to music and play games. Dawson told them that sounded fun, and 
offered them each a fresh picked apple off his tree. They gladly accepted. 
Dawson had the best apples in town.

	　　艾米也对他微笑，告诉他珍妮特会陪她过夜，她们要一起听音乐玩游戏。道森告诉她们这听上去很有趣，给她们每人一个从他的树上刚摘下来的苹果。她们很高兴地接受了，因为道森的苹果是镇上最棒的。

	　　When they got out of Dawson?on earshot, Janet asked Amy, “Everyone says 
he’s the meanest man in town. How come was he so nice to us?”

	　　走到道森听不到的地方，珍妮特问艾米：“每个人都说他是镇上最不好打交道的人，但他为什么对我们这么好呢?”
